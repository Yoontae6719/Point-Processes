## What is temporal point process?

Temporal point processes(TPPs) are probabilistic generative models for continous[discrete]-time event sequence. More specifically, temporal point processes are generative models of variable-length point seqeunces observed on the real line(i.e. time-interval). Many applicaions in industry and science are concerned with collection of event with timestamps.
TPPs are essential to predict the event occurrence time and what kind of event will occur in the future. I believe that TPPs combined with deep learning will play a very important role in industry.
